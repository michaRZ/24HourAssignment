### Summary:
The 24 Hour Assignment was a test of our ability to work as a team of developers on a social media-type application. Each of us worked with a specific feature (Posts, Comments, or Replies) individually and utilised GitHub to integrate our work into one functional application. 


#### Reflections:
What We Did Well:
- Frequent commits on our individual branches
- Checking in to make sure we were not merging at the same time
- Asking questions to the team to make the most of our collective knowledge and problem-solve
- Keeping a sense of humor and humility about our work -- team motto: 'Failing Forward!'

What We Can Work On:
- Bettering our understanding of git in a team setting
- Making use of Slack and other tools to communicate efficiently
- Detailed organisation of roles at the start of our project and checking in on progress (using Trello or the like)
- Practice Agile methodology to work more effectively on small portions of the project as a unit
